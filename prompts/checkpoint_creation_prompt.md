Project Checkpoint: [Your Project Name]

Date: [Current Date - e.g., May 19, 2025]
Document Version: 1.0 (or increment if updating an existing one)
Overall Project Vision/Goal:
Briefly describe the main objective or end-goal of the project.
Current Status Summary:
What is the overall state? E.g., "Initial setup phase complete," "Core feature X implemented," "Debugging issue Y."
What was the very last significant action or milestone achieved?
Key Decisions & Selections Made So Far:
List major choices regarding technology stack, architecture, key libraries, third-party services, design approaches, etc.
Example: "Chose Tech Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Stripe."
Example: "Decided to use X approach for Y feature."
Major Accomplishments / Milestones Reached:
List significant achievements, successful setups, or resolved critical issues.
Example: "Successfully set up local development environment."
Example: "Integrated X API and confirmed data flow."
Example: "Resolved critical bug related to Y."
Current Key Configurations (if applicable, e.g., important .env variables, database schema highlights):
Briefly note any critical configuration states or data structures that are currently in place and working.
Example: ".env.local confirmed with correct Supabase service_role_key and Stripe test keys."
Example: "Database schema for [table_name] table is now correctly established."
Key Learnings / Important Notes for Future Reference:
List any important insights, workarounds discovered, or things to be mindful of moving forward in this specific project context. Avoid lengthy error logs, but capture the lesson if a recurring type of problem was identified and solved.
Example: "Reminder: Always restart dev server after .env.local changes."
Example: "Note: X service requires Y specific configuration detail to avoid Z issue."
Current Challenges or Blockers (if any):
If there's an unresolved issue we were working on just before this checkpoint, briefly state it.
Immediate Next Steps (Top 1-3 priorities):
Based on where we left off, what are the very next concrete actions to take to move the project forward?
Example: "1. Implement user profile editing page."
Example: "2. Begin integration with Z service API."
Please generate this document in a clear, concise "one-sheet" style, ideally in Markdown format if possible. Focus on the information that would be most useful for quickly re-orienting to the project after a break or for onboarding someone new to the current state. Avoid excessive detail about minor debugging unless it led to a key learning.
