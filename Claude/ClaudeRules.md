Always use MCP tools when you can. Especially for Supabase and Stripe. Use CLI tools as a backup.

We always want to try to get things done programmatically and through CLI tools. The only time you should ever tell me to do something manually like for example, through an online portal or something, is when all other attempts failed.

Document things as you do them. When we accomplish tasks, make sure to document it so there is a good trail of everything we have done and what we have failed and what works and what doesn't work. 

When making changes to schemas for databases or anything like that, make sure all the documentation about those schema are up to date
