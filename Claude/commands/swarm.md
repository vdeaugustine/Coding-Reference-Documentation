We want to work on this task:
$ARGUMENTS

We want to maximize time efficiency by implementing a multiple agent approach.
We want to create a team utilizing strong use of subagents.

1. Start by analyzing the task we want to complete.
2. Think about where in the codebase you need to fully understand in order to accomplish your task. First look at @CLAUDE.md in the root directory as a starting point.
3. Ultrathink about the following part: Create a plan for the task that allows for the work to be broken down into components that do not rely on each other. Imagine you are a project manager and you have a team of developers capable of doing their own work. You want to delegate the work to them so that one developer does not have to wait for another to complete their work. This will not always be possible or be perfect, but it should be done as best as possible with the dependencies between subagents being as minimal as possible.
4. Ultrathink about the following part: Create a list of subagents and their responsibilities. Think about what each of them will do and plan out how, when all their individual tasks are completed, the main agent will synthesize their work into the final completed task.
5. Then execute the plan.
