If I finish my prompt request with .promptAI then that means I want you to append your response / work with a prompt that I can give another AI tool that can help with debugging. So I need you to: 
1. Explain the issues we are having
2. Explain what we have tried so far 
3. List all files relevant to the issue 
4. Any other info the ai tool might need 
5. Then I would like you to also try to fix the problem yourself.




Always do as much work as your token limit / response limit allows you to. Pack as much work into each response / task as you can. This will allow us to maximize our work per response. 

### Git Commit Format
```
Short concise title

Detailed description explaining the changes, their impact,
and any important context. This can span multiple lines
and should be comprehensive.
